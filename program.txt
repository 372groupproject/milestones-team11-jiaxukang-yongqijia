1. Our program will implement a random color  generator in ellipse.

2.We expect the program to have one ellipse. This ellipse have 3 parts. When user clicks on 
different parts, it changes to random color from black.

3. We expect the program to has less than 100 lines of code.

4. We think this program will be a good illustration of the features of our language because it 
has own packages. We use it as a GUI. This GUI has different objects. We combine these objects into
a shape. We also give events that change color when user clicks on each object. This program 
shows Smalltalk is the language that started the Object Oriented Programming revolution.
